"""Object Placing Supervisor Prototype v7
   Written by Robbie Goldman and Alfred Roberts

Features:
 - Places humans and obstacles randomly
 - Will not intersect walls or other objects
 - Will not be within 4 units of bases

Changelog:
 V2:
 - Bases now retrieved from their own group
 - Dynamic obstacles
 - Activity placement
 V3:
 - Waits for main supervisor to call for generation first (prevents double)
 V4:
 - Overhauled to not use walls but rooms instead (will not work with old world files)
 V5:
 - Added identification of adjacent rooms (connected by doors) for future use and relocation
 V6
 - Added reject counter to prevent crashing when placement isn't possible
 - Activities placed before obstacles
 V7
 - Adjusted radius calculations so they are the correct size not double
